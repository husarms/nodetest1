                            Awhile ago I had the opportunity to spend a few months in Japan.
                            I took a ton of pictures while I was over there, but never had a chance to put a narrative behind them.
                        p Well - I am finally getting around to doing just that. Due to the amount of content I will be breaking this up into multiple parts.
                        p So without further ado this is part 1.

                            After a 14 hour flight we arrived in Japan at Narita, the country's predominant international airport located outside of Tokyo.

                            We collected our luggage, exchanged our currency for yen and made our way to our hotel.

                            We stayed for the night at the Narita Airport Rest House, just a short walk from the arrival terminals.
                            This is the view from the hotel.

                            I turned on the TV to see President Obama with subtitles. I remember my room smelled heavily of cigarette smoke - but I was too jet-lagged to care.

                            Our mission the next day was to take several trains to our ultimate designation of Yonago, in the Tottori prefecture.
                            We made our way to the train station - first stopping at McDonald's. This was my first real experience with just how serious the Japanese
                            are about customer service - even the average fast food worker is super polite, cheery and helpful. I knew practically zero Japanese - luckily
                            they had a large menu with pictures at the counter and I could just point at what I wanted to order.

                            I saw this on the menu and pointed at it right away.
                            Here is the Japanese McDonald's exclusive "Mega Muffin" - double sausage and bacon, egg, cheese and lots of ketchup.
                            The double meat seemed like a very American thing to do - so I was a bit surprised.

                            Inside the Shikansen. These things are honestly amazing - super quick and quiet.
                            The maglev floating sensation makes it feel similar to being in a plane - but a lot less cramped.
                            This picture gives a good idea of how spacious and comfortable the interiors are.
