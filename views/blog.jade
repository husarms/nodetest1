                            In 2011 I had the opportunity to spend a few months in Japan. It was an amazing experience - if you've ever thought of going I would highly recommend it.
                            I took a ton of pictures while I was over there, but never had a chance to put a narrative behind them.
                        p Well - I am finally getting around to doing just that. Due to the amount of content I will be breaking this up into multiple parts.
                        p So without further ado this is part 1.

                            Awhile back I took a Coursera class offered through the University of London called
                            <a href='https://www.coursera.org/course/digitalmedia', target='_blank'>Creative Programming for Digital Media & Mobile Apps.</a>
                            The course focused on applying programming to the development of creative works that make use of graphics and audio.

                            Here is a demo I created for one the course assignments - an audio visualizer written in Javascript using <a href='https://processingjs.org/',target='_blank'>Processing.js</a>.
