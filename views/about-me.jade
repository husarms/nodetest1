                    p Hello, my name is Matt and I'm a software developer.
                    p I wasn't always like this. In school I was torn between studying art, English or engineering. After taking an introductory programming class, a light bulb went off. Here is something that combined my interests and gave me the ability to design and build things that are highly technical but also use it as a way to express myself creatively. I have been coding ever since.
                    p I mainly gravitate towards web development - I enjoy the challenges it brings along with the ability to share your work with anyone with a web browser.
                    p Professionally I have developed mainly in the .NET world - but have also worked with Java and a lot of open-source frameworks.
                    p I recently dived into the world of Javascript-based web development. In fact, this site started as a way to learn and experiment with Node.js.
