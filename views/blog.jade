                        p In 2011 I had the opportunity to spend a few months in Japan. It was an amazing experience - if you've ever thought of going I would highly recommend it. I took a ton of pictures while I was over there, but never had a chance to put a narrative behind them.
                        p Well - I am finally getting around to doing just that. Due to the amount of content I will be breaking this up into multiple parts.
                        p So without further ado this is part 1.
