                    p Hello, my name is Matt and I'm a software developer.
                    p.
                        I wasn't always like this. In school I was torn between studying art, English or engineering. I moved towards software after taking an introductory
                        programming class. It was something that combined my interests and gave me the ability to design and build things that are highly technical - but
                        could also be used as a way to express myself creatively.
                    p.
                        I mainly gravitate towards web development - I enjoy the challenges it brings along with the ability to share your work with anyone anywhere.
                    p.
                        Professionally I have developed mainly in the .NET world - but have worked with many other languages and stacks.
                        Most recently I have dived into the world of Javascript-based web development. In fact, this site started as a way to learn and experiment with Node.js.
